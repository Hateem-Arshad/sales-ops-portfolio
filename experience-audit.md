## Section 2 — Three Strongest Evidence Points

### Evidence Point 1 — ERP System
At Japan Gold Refinery (a multi-subsidiary freezone and mainland business) I was responsible for the complete data and operations infrastructure. A complete ERP system was designed and implemented using Excel VBA - vat compliance automated invoicing system, double entry bookkeeping, automated financial statements was implemented across two legal entities. Headcount of a larger financial team and additional software licensing costs of a commercial ERP system was avoided by the design and infrastructure I implemented.

### Evidence Point 2 — Fraud Detection
While performing routine reconciliations, I identified a pattern of variance between reported figures and actual transactions. I built pivot tables and dashboards to validate the hypothesis and conducted  manual reconciliation of records to quantify the gaps. I presented my findings to the managing director in a face to face meeting, as a result the managing director came up with a exit strategy to sell the business and move to Qatar (a direct consequence of the audit findings I presented).

### Evidence Point 3 — Systems Thinking/Architect
I identified that excel VBA and the formulas were becoming slow and started use a lot of hardware resources as the database grew. I learnt the difference between a flat-file database and a relational database, I started to migrate the data to SQL database into a relational database structure.

## Section 4 — My Sales Ops Story in Two Sentences
My instinct when I join a business is to understand how things actually work versus how they are supposed to work — and then build the infrastructure that closes that gap; at Japan Gold Refinery that meant designing a complete financial and operational system from scratch that replaced what would have been a full finance team and a commercial ERP. I am moving into Sales Operations because it is the function where that combination of systems-thinking, data integrity, and pipeline diagnostics creates the most direct commercial value — and I am formalising it with SQL, Python, and ops methodology to operate at the level the work has always deserved.
